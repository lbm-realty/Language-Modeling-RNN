It had been a very busy warm summer day. Catherine felt rushed and tired. Her feet were aching from
wandering around the city, foot work as Joe liked to refer to this part of her work, always with a crooked
smile.
She sighed and looked forward to taking a shower and getting changed. The prospect of spending an
evening with Vincent was a stimulating force.
Later, on her way to the tunnels, she took a walk through the park, inhaling the air of a summer evening.
“Today, it’s the longest day and the shortest night of the year. What a wonderful idea to top such an
special evening with Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”, and smiled as she thought of them
enjoying it together.
With these thoughts, she left those of her daily professional life behind and continued her walk with a
more buoyant and joyful step, floating the bond with happiness.
Meanwhile below, Vincent picked up a little picnic basket. William had offered to arrange some of his
extraordinary specials for the two of them. As Vincent felt her emotions, he started to smile.
When Catherine arrived finally they hugged one another intensely and the look in their eyes did their
hearts good.
They gathered the needed goods and made their way hand-in-hand to their private theatre box, beneath
at the feet of the front row, where they made themselves comfortable.
“Have I ever told you how much I’m enjoying these long warm summer evenings in your company?”
Catherine kissed him with delight, delicately on his nose, fishing for one of William specials.
